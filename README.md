# Brain Network Alterations in Chronic Spinal Cord Injury: Mesoscale Graph Analysis
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the research project titled "Brain Network Alterations in Chronic Spinal Cord Injury: Mesoscale Graph Analysis." This repository contains code and resources related to our study, which explores cortical reorganization in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) using resting-state fMRI-based functional connectivity and mesoscale graph analysis.

## Abstract
Cortical reorganization is a pivotal factor influencing neurological recovery in individuals grappling with spinal cord injury (SCI). The assessment of such reorganization is often facilitated through resting-state fMRI-based functional connectivity analysis coupled with network (graph) analysis. While macroscale metrics, which offer a holistic view of brain function, provide valuable insights into cortical reorganization patterns, they often fall short in capturing localized and modular alterations within cortical functional networks. In this study, we leveraged mesoscale graph analysis techniques, encompassing recruitment and integration coefficients derived from parcel- and network-level module allegiance matrices, to unveil the finer nuances of cortical functional network changes in individuals with chronic SCI. Our findings uncovered notable shifts in somatomotor, visual, and other functional networks across the brain. Particularly intriguing was the discernible pattern of segregation observed within the somatomotor network, aligning with the boundaries of brain regions responsible for somatomotor representations of the upper-lower body and orofacial regions in chronic SCI patients. Additionally, significant alterations emerged within and between visual networks, indicating reduced integration between visual and somatomotor network nodes and heightened recruitment within visual network nodes in the SCI group. Collectively, these findings shed light on potential compensatory adaptations in response to disrupted spinal cord-brain communication and underscore the utility of mesoscale graph measures in unraveling the intricate processes of brain functional reorganization in individuals with chronic SCI.

## An overview of the analysis pipeline
This flowchart outlines the step-by-step data analysis process for investigating cortical reorganization in individuals with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI). Beginning with the utilization of preprocessed fMRI data to construct brain networks, nodes representing different brain regions are interconnected (Figure 1A). A multi-layer community detection algorithm is then applied to uncover modular structures within these networks (Figure 1B). Subsequently, modularity-related metrics are computed to assess the strength of community divisions in the brain networks (Figure 1C). Co-occurrence matrices are generated to analyze node interactions across layers or participants (Figure 1D), while parcel-level module allegiance matrices are created to investigate community stability (Figure 1E). Finally, mesoscale network coefficients, including recruitment and integration, are calculated for comparing community structures between groups, offering insights into brain network organization and differences between the SCI and healthy control groups (Figure 1F).
