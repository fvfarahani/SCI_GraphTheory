# Brain Network Alterations in Chronic Spinal Cord Injury: Mesoscale Graph Analysis
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the research project titled "Brain Network Alterations in Chronic Spinal Cord Injury: Mesoscale Graph Analysis." This repository contains code and resources related to our study, which explores cortical reorganization in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) using resting-state fMRI-based functional connectivity and mesoscale graph analysis.

## Abstract
Cortical reorganization is a pivotal factor influencing neurological recovery in individuals grappling with spinal cord injury (SCI). The assessment of such reorganization is often facilitated through resting-state fMRI-based functional connectivity analysis coupled with network (graph) analysis. While macroscale metrics, which offer a holistic view of brain function, provide valuable insights into cortical reorganization patterns, they often fall short in capturing localized and modular alterations within cortical functional networks. In this study, we leveraged mesoscale graph analysis techniques, encompassing recruitment and integration coefficients derived from parcel- and network-level module allegiance matrices, to unveil the finer nuances of cortical functional network changes in individuals with chronic SCI. Our findings uncovered notable shifts in somatomotor, visual, and other functional networks across the brain. Particularly intriguing was the discernible pattern of segregation observed within the somatomotor network, aligning with the boundaries of brain regions responsible for somatomotor representations of the upper-lower body and orofacial regions in chronic SCI patients. Additionally, significant alterations emerged within and between visual networks, indicating reduced integration between visual and somatomotor network nodes and heightened recruitment within visual network nodes in the SCI group. Collectively, these findings shed light on potential compensatory adaptations in response to disrupted spinal cord-brain communication and underscore the utility of mesoscale graph measures in unraveling the intricate processes of brain functional reorganization in individuals with chronic SCI.

## An overview of the analysis pipeline
(A) Searchlight connectivity hyperalignment is performed in three steps: first, a connectome is created for each participant (i.e., a similarity matrix made up of data and targets); second, for a given searchlight across participants, the local transformation per subject and the common model is computed (here, an example for two subjects is shown); third, a mapper (whole-cortex transformation) is obtained for each participant by aggregating their local transformations. (B) Fine-scale graph analysis. A connectome was created using both the original and hyperaligned data. For each type, the connectomes were used to compute networks and a series of commonly used graph measures. Group-level statistical analysis was performed on the extracted measures.
